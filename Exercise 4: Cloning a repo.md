### Exercise 4: Cloning a repo

1. Go to the folder where you want to clone the project (and make sure you are not in a git repo with `git status`)
2. Copy the Git URL of the forked repo (in GitHub)
3. Clone the repo:   `git clone [url_from_github]`
4. Modify, stage, commit
5. Let's push our changes to 'origin': `git push origin master`
6. Let's see what's happened in GitHub...
7. Make a new change in GitHub, then a new change in local
8. Push to origin. What happens?
9. We'll need to pull the changes from origin, then push...
