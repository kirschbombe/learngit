### Exercise 2: Git Branches

*We'll do this exercise on our local environment*

1. Check to see which branch you are on: `git status`
2. List all branches: `git branch`
3. Create a new branch: `git branch [new_branch]`
4. List your branches again
5. Switch to your new branch: `git checkout`
6. Make some changes in your new branch and commit
7. Switch back to branch master: `git checkout master`
8. Let's take a look at our files and folders - see how the file system reflects your current branch?
9. Merge changes from your new branch into master: `git merge [new_branch]`
